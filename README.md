# Advent of Code 2023 - LOLCODE edeition

### Why would you do that?

I like the pain, and it definitely is better than php.

### How can I set this up?
Just don't.

If you really want to do that, you need to get your hands on a LOLCODE interpreter. There is an excellent interpreter written by Justin Meza available on his [Github](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci/blob/future).
Make sure to use the "future" branch, because it contains some extremely advanced functionality like using files or getting a character in a string.

### How can I run tests?

### Why did you code X like that?
Either I didn't know a better way, LOLCODE did not support it, or I was just a dumb dumb.

I decided to not do refactorings during each task, so the code is pretty much a learning experience and evolves from day to day. An example is using bukkits as class-like constructs starting from Solution1B.

### Does LOLCODE support feature XYZ?
